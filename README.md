# StarBacksStores_OpenLayers
## Discripsion:
For this task we used an api that provides us a list of Starbucks stores.<br>

By running the program and using openLayers we will get a map <br>
with points that mark all the Starbucks stores in the world.
From the list of countries that have these stores, one country is selected, 
and the map seems to focus on that part (by zooming to the location of the stores).
